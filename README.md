## Summary

The Advanced References and Objects (ARO) Library for C++ is collection of classes
and supporting utilities that form a class hierarchy having the class `aro::Object`
as its root (i.e. the base class). All classes in the ARO Library are derived either
from the class `aro::Object` or from other `aro::Object`-derived classes.

Additional features of the ARO Library include simplified primitive data types and sizes,
class and interface specifications, automatic memory management using smart references,
multitheading synchronization, data and object streaming (i.e. serialization), and more.
